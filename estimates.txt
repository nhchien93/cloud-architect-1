RTO is the time frame within which an asset (network, service) must come back online if it goes down.
RPO is the acceptable amount of data (measured by time) we are willing to lose in case of an incident.

Estimations

For a single AZ outage, it takes about 1-2 minutes for AWS to start a new RDS instance in another AZ, so the RTO is 1-2 minutes.
In this case, because we failover from Primary database to Secondary database. So there is no data loss, this means the RPO is 0.

For a region outage, it takes about 3-5 minutes for promoting the replica, so the RTO is 3-5 minutes.
In this case, because reading replica is asynchronous cross region, so the RPO is 6-10 minutes.
